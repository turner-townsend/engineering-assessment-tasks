# Candidate materials

Everything in this folder is **safe to share with candidates**. It does not contain scoring
rubrics, interviewer scripts, or calibration notes.

cd base-app
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build   # API on :8000

## Take-home task rules (summary)

- **Time cap:** max 90 minutes (stop at 90 min and document what's left in `SOLUTION.md`)
- **Submit:** zip + `SOLUTION.md` (decisions, trade-offs, **AI/tooling disclosure**)
- **Tests:** proportional to scope; quality over quantity
- **AI:** allowed if disclosed; you must explain and change your code in live sessions
- **Marked:** your take-home is scored as part of the application, alongside the live sessions
